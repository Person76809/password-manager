# password-manager
Open a terminal or command prompt. Enter the following command: pip install stdiomask. You should see some output indicating that stdiomask was successfully installed. Once stdiomask is installed, you should be able to import it in your code and use it to prompt the user for a password.

It defines a filename for storing passwords, loads any existing passwords from the file, prompts the user to enter a service, username, and password, stores the password in a dictionary, saves the updated dictionary to the file, and prints a confirmation message. It uses the json and getpass modules, which are standard modules in Python.
